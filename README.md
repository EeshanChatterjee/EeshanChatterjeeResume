My Public resume

The Information contained in the files in this Repo is same. The data, however, is different. The format- how the information is arranged is different. Another difference is what format you will pick up, based on your likes and your use case. It is an important question challenging Data Scientists all across the globe, How do we retrieve information stored across data formats and languages and mould it into coherence?

All this to convey just the one thing- Hire Me! :D
